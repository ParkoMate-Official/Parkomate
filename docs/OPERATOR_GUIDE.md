* **Middle left**: the steps. **Middle right**: the results.
* **Bottom**: what is still needed, and the **blue button** (next action).

![Error](screenshots/en_19_error_measurement_timeout.png)

Do the numbered steps, then press the button on the right (**Try again**, **Measure again**,
**Scan again** …). If it keeps happening, call the supervisor and show the screen.

## 9. Finish later - do some steps now, the rest later

You do not have to take a board from A to D in one go.

1. Press **Finish later** on any screen. The green message says which tray the board goes to,
   e.g. "put it in the tray for Testing". Put it there.
2. Later - the same day, another day, you or someone else - connect the board as usual on the
   Programming screen. The station opens the step the board is waiting for and shows what was
   already done.

Steps already finished are kept. If the step on the screen was started but not finished, the
station asks first: that step starts again next time.

## 10. End of shift

1. Press **Session** (top right) → **End session** → **End session** again to confirm.
2. The summary shows your counts. The report is sent (or saved and sent later).
3. Press **Log out**.

**Esc** never deletes anything. A board still on the bench at the end of the session (or if
the station closes by accident) keeps the steps it passed: put it in the tray of the step it
was on, anyone can finish it later.
