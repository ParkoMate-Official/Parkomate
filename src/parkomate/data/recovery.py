"""Crash recovery, run once at start-up before anybody logs in.

Only one station process runs per PC (the UI enforces a single instance), so any session
still open at start-up belongs to a run that crashed or lost power. For each one:

* every ``in_progress`` device becomes ``abandoned`` (finished at the last recorded activity);
  a retest that was running puts its repair case back to ``repaired``;
* the session is closed with ``end_reason = 'crash_recovered'``;
* an audit entry is written.

The caller then queues the session report for e-mail (see ``parkomate.mail.reporting``).
